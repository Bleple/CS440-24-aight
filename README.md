# CS440-24-aight
The final project for aight (group name) CS440 for the Fall 2024 class at csu.
## How to run the project
The code and results as run in testing are provided as a .ipynb (jupyter notebook file). 

This was made using the Jupyter extension for vscode, but other Jupyter notebook compatible platforms should work as well. 

The results can be viewed, or the code segments can be run sequentially to verify the results. 

The results were obtained while running using a RTX 4070 GPU.
